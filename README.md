# rachel-capstone

This project is an extension of my MIT research, and uses mock data (generated by hhz@mit.edu) since the data is underlying data of the financial intermediation of trade credit are proprietary at the Central Bank of Brazil.

There are three categories of data sets:
- **Asset issuance:** `df_fac_nr`, `df_fac_r`, `fof_fsbm_nr`, `fof_fsm_rec`, `foc_fsbm_nr`, `foc_fsm_rec`
- **Fund flows:** `df_fund_flows` (at the fund-shareholder-transaction level), `df_fund_flows_panel` (aggregated to the fund-month level)
- **Fund and asset snapshots:** `df_fund_stat`, `df_nav`, `df_portfolio`, `df_fac_snap`

In my capstone project R file I merged and modified the data sets such that the analysis is all within one data frame (see code after line 370)
